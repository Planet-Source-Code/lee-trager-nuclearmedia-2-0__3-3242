### Source Code

NuclearMedia 2.0 is a media SDK that can play most media files including m3u playlists (the winamp playlist). It uses Windows API except NuclearM3U.h. This API is only available on Windows 98/NT and up. NuclearM3U.h can be run on any OS but not tested. There is a class that connects all the engines together so you don’t have to. It is very easy to use, but the code is pretty advanced. This can be used in any type of program console, win32, ect. Most (all that I found) have been fixed if you see any contact me.
